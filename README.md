Part of my thesis work centered on the moduli space of unlabeled networks. We studied properties of $\mathbb{R}_{\ge 0}^N/\Sigma_n$, where $\Sigma_n$ is a permutation group acting by rearranging vertices, which induces a permutation on the $N = \binom{n}{2}$ edges where $n$ is the number of vertices.
